# Advent of Code 2023
My solution for this year's Advent of Code in Python. Like [last year](https://github.com/ndieckow/aoc2022), I'll try to write a few words about each solution, mainly focusing on the complexity.

In general, $N$ always refers to the number of lines in the input. If not, I will mention it.

## Day 01
For part 1, the complexity is $\mathcal O(N \cdot m)$, where $m$ is the length of the longest string. Assuming it to be constant, we have linear complexity, $\mathcal O(N)$. For part 2, we have an additional loop through all one-digit numbers, but since there's always exactly 10 of them, the complexity remains linear.
